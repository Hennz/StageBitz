         <h2>StageBitz&#8482; is the first product to be released from Production Genie&reg; Pty Ltd.</h2>
         <br /> At Production Genie&reg; Pty Ltd, we are committed to developing software to support the production process for theatre
         and the performing arts. While lighting, sound, multi-media, automation and other elements of the industry have blossomed
         with the benefit that innovations in technology have offered them, the core management process for a production and the
         tools we have to support that have remained essentially the same for decades. <br /> <br /> The huge creative capacity of
         those of us who work in production, stage and workshop management means that we have found ways of adapting other
         technology to help us keep us on top of things but at Production Genie&reg; we aim to provide you with software solutions
         specifically made for our industry. We want to make it easy for you to collaborate, be creative and do your job well. <br />
         <br /> StageBitz&#8482; is the first product to be released and we have more in development. <br /> <br /> For more
